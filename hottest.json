I did measurements with the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite and found a speedup factor 2.5 on Linux compared to LuaJIT (see \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/testcases/Are-we-fast-yet/Are-we-fast-yet_results_linux.pdf\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/testcases/Are-we-fast-yet/Are-we-fast-yet_results_linux.pdf\u003c/a\u003e for more information). Mono is still sufficiently fast compared to the new CoreCLR engine from Microsoft; I did measurements with different versions of Mono and CoreCLR and found performance differences to be within 30% (see \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Mono-CLR-really-slower-than-CoreCLR/answer/Rochus-Keller\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://www.quora.com/Is-the-Mono-CLR-really-slower-than-CoreCLR/answer/Rochus-Keller\u003c/a\u003e for more information). I prefer Mono over CoreCLR because of wider platform support, the soft-debugger wire protocol (which the Oberon+ IDE uses) and the lean minimal configuration (less than 10 MB).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe generated assemblies have been successfully tested on Windows, macOS and Linux, with Mono, CoreCLR and .NET, 32 as well as 64 bits (with many issues fixed since the MVP release on October 1st).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is a version of the \u003cstrong\u003eOberon System\u003c/strong\u003e as an example: \u003ca href=\"http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonSystem_SDL_CLI_Assemblies.zip\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttp://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonSystem_SDL_CLI_Assemblies.zip\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the binary versions (download, unpack/mount and run, no installation requried, examples included) for Windows, macOS and Linux i386:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_win32.zip\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttp://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_win32.zip\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_macOS_x64.dmg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttp://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_macOS_x64.dmg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_linux_i386.tar.gz\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttp://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_linux_i386.tar.gz\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course you can also build it yourself; build instructions are included in the referenced README.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nr80x6/ide_for_oberon_programming_language","submitter_user":{"username":"Rochus","created_at":"2020-07-11T16:57:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"See http://www.rochus-keller.ch","is_moderator":false,"karma":22,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Rochus-100.png","invited_by_user":"technomancy"},"tags":["c++","compilers","dotnet","programming"]},{"short_id":"uwixsl","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uwixsl","created_at":"2021-10-10T09:31:23.000-05:00","title":"Singularity ‚Äì Microsoft‚Äôs Experimental OS","url":"https://codingkaiser.blog/2021/07/23/operating-systems-are-more-exciting-than-you-think/","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uwixsl/singularity_microsoft_s_experimental_os","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":12696,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["dotnet","osdev"]},{"short_id":"e1rup6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/e1rup6","created_at":"2021-10-10T23:35:49.000-05:00","title":"TLS Certificate Transparency logs let us assess Certificate Authorities","url":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TLSCTLetsUsMeasureCAUsage","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/e1rup6/tls_certificate_transparency_logs_let_us","submitter_user":{"username":"Corbin","created_at":"2018-10-13T21:40:32.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Secure distributed computation should not be hard.\r\n\r\nmi pu'i tavla fo lo jbobau .i mi'e la korvo","is_moderator":false,"karma":3059,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Corbin-100.png","invited_by_user":"infinisil"},"tags":["browsers","web"]}]
