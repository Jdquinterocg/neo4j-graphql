Measurements of Homa/Linux reconfirm Homa‚Äôs superior performance compared to TCP and DCTCP. In a cluster benchmark with 40 nodes, Homa/Linux provided lower latency than both TCP and DCTCP for all message sizes; for short messages, Homa‚Äôs 99th percentile tail latency was 7‚Äì83x lower than TCP and DCTCP. The benchmarks also show that Homa has eliminated network congestion as a significant performance limitation. Both tail latency and throughput are now limited by software overheads, particularly software congestion caused by imperfect load balancing of the protocol stack across cores.
