However, unlike regular testing, PBT is not widespread in collegiate curricula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the value of PBT is not limited to software testing. The growing use of formal methods in industry, and the growth of software synthesis, all create demand for techniques to train students and developers in the art of specification writing. We posit that PBT forms a strong bridge between testing and the act of specification: it‚Äôs a form of testing where the tester is actually writing abstract specifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInquiry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven well-informed technologists mention the difficulty of finding good motivating examples for its use.

We also notice that such problems are readily available in the computer science pantheon of problems (e.g., many graph and sorting algorithms). We have been using these for some years now to teach PBT in collegiate courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrounding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this paper, we describe the problems we use and report on students‚Äô completion of them. We believe the problems overcome some of the motivation issues described above. We also show that students can do quite well at PBT for these problems, suggesting that the topic is well within their reach. In the process, we introduce a simple method to evaluate the accuracy of their specifications, and use it to characterize their common mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBased on our findings, we believe that relational problems are an underutilized motivating example for PBT.

From mid-2017 to late 2020, I worked for Microsoft on the Windows accessibility team, though my comments were always my own opinion posted on my own initiative.\r\n\r\nI'm legally blind myself; I have enough sight to read a desktop computer screen up close with slightly enlarged fonts, but I often use a screen reader when browsing the Web, doing email, and other tasks that don't involve code. (Don't get me wrong; totally blind people can program, but I never got used to doing it that way myself.)\r\n\r\nOf course, there's more to me than visual impairment. When it comes to programming, I'm also particularly interested in the challenges of developing cross-platform applications that integrate smoothly with the host platform. Outside of programming, I love music and love to sing. Pre-COVID, I often did karaoke (of course, I memorize the words).
