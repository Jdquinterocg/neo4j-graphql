It has the advantage of mechanized proof,  and it is possible to model a system in several levels of abstraction by using refinement.Discrete  timing  properties  are  important  in  many  critical  systems.   How-ever, modelling of timing properties is not directly supported in Event-B. In this paper we identify three main categories of discrete timing properties for trigger-response patterns,deadline,delay and expiry.  We introduce language constructs for each of these timing properties that augment the Event-B language.  We describe how these constructs have been given a semantic in terms of the standard Event-B constructs. To ease the process of using timing properties in a refinement-based development, we introduce patterns for refining the timing constructs that allow timing properties on abstract models to bere placed by timing properties on refined models.  The language constructs and refinement patterns are illustrated through some generic examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tqdpgn/extending_event_b_with_discrete_timing","submitter_user":{"username":"nickpsecurity","created_at":"2016-07-28T14:11:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Previously:\r\n\r\nWhite nerd who grew up in mostly-poor environments with country rednecks, black gangstas, and few opportunities. Well-off just long enough to know how skewed system was.

In security, my specialty was high-assurance security to defend against nation-state attackers (esp inventing/evaluating techniques). That's systems provably invulnerable to known classes of attack, limiting damage of unknown classes, recovering to safe state after any attack, and optionally fault-tolerant techniques to keep them at five 9's reliability.\r\n\r\nCurrently (officially June 2020):\r\n\r\nCalled by, returned to, and growing in the Lord Jesus Christ. Since then, I've experienced personal transformation, miracles, and more. 2020 went from a nightmare to an adventure! It all started with the promises of the Word of God (Bible).\r\n\r\nThe Word of God impacted over a billion people of all types in more than 196 countries. Tells us about who God is, us, our problems, His solution, and much wisdom. Takes a *long* time to read, though. \r\n\r\nFor that reason, I put up a [site](https://www.heswithjesus.com) that condenses it to minutes, has a page with evidence it's true, my story, and my old sins. The latter two show Jesus can reach anyone no matter their past or current challenges. My sins up on site that only looses money is proof I'm honest about that. There's no psychological or scientific explanation for much of what's happened: only God could do it.

Designing, evaluating and modeling systems that are resilient against memory errors requires a good understanding of DRAM errors in the field. The few studies of DRAM errors in production systems have been too limited in data set size or granularity to answer many open questions on DRAM errors, e.g. the prevalence of soft errors compared to hard errors, or analysis of hard error patterns.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this paper, we study data on DRAM errors collected on a diverse range of production systems covering nearly 300 terabyte-years of main memory. We provide a detailed analytical study of DRAM error characteristics, including hard and soft errors. We identify many promising directions for designing more resilient systems and evaluate the potential of different protection mechanisms in the light of realistic error patterns. One of our findings is that simple page retirement policies might be able to mask a large number of DRAM errors in production systems while sacrificing only a negligible fraction of the total DRAM in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pdackb/cosmic_rays_don_t_strike_twice","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1821,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["hardware","pdf"]},{"short_id":"utjhzn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/utjhzn","created_at":"2021-07-16T09:14:25.000-05:00","title":"Locating Everyday Objects using NFC Textiles","url":"https://www.witechlab.com/papers/textilesense-ipsn2021.pdf","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/utjhzn/locating_everyday_objects_using_nfc","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software developer.
